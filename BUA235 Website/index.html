<p><b>Welcome to my web site!</b> I am a senior in the Construction Engineering Technology program here at Umaine. Well in college I have spent my summers working as a project management intern for a general contractor in the greater Boston area. I am expecting to graduate in May 2020 where I am looking forward to working full time in construction. In my free time I really enjoy following Boston sports teams, working out, and building things.</p>
